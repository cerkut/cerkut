### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am taking challenges torwards [Edge AI](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/), [Active and Perceptual Inference](https://www.activeinference.institute/) Quantum Computing (QC), Quantum Machine Learning (QML), based on my work on [sonic](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sonic_interaction_design) and [embodied interaction](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:embodied_interaction&after_author=48AAAFD1__8J&astart=10) using neural sound and motion synthesis. 

ðŸ”­ My mission is to bridge X-verse, AI, and QC/QML through academic/industrial [ML](https://github.com/chiphuyen/dmls-book) / [AI engineering](https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book) practices.

ðŸ“« You can get more info about me & my work at https://cerkut.github.io/

- âš¡ Fun fact: [*1997* is the year of my first paper on Neural Audio with Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2543549_Calibration_Of_Physical_Models_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks_With_Application_To_Plucked_String_Instruments/citations).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  -  [Edge Impulse](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/),
  -  [TinyML](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/), and
