### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am taking challenges torwards [Edge AI](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/), [Active and Perceptual Inference](https://www.activeinference.institute/) Quantum Computing (QC), Quantum Machine Learning (QML), based on my work on [sonic](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sonic_interaction_design) and [embodied interaction](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:embodied_interaction&after_author=48AAAFD1__8J&astart=10) using neural sound and motion synthesis. 

ðŸ”­ My mission is to bridge X-verse, AI, and QC/QML through academic/industrial [ML](https://github.com/chiphuyen/dmls-book) / [AI engineering](https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book) practices.

ðŸ“« You can get more info about me & my work at https://cerkut.github.io/

 ðŸ‘¯ If you are here for cookiecutters / packages for ...
 - ML Engineering: check https://github.com/fmind/mlops-python-package
 - AI Engineering: check https://github.com/callmesora/llmops-python-package
 - Quantum ML Eng: you have to wait a bit. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- - Qiskit-Ops, starting with how to maintain my < v1 models https://github.com/andrzejwichert/qai_1
  - [Edge Impulse](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/) and [TinyML](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/), and
